/* # Job Shop Scheduling
A simple job shop consists of a set of different machines that process jobs. 
Each job consists of series of tasks that must be completed in specified order
on the machines. The problem is to schedule the jobs on the machines to minimize 
makespan.
Data consists of two tables. The first table is decomposition of the jobs into
a series of tasks. Each task lists a job name, name of the required machine, 
and task duration.  The second table list task pairs where the first task must 
be completed before the second task can be started. This formulation is quite 
general, but can also specify situations with no feasible solutions.
